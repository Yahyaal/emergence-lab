## J-014 · 2026-11-07 · v0.7: Flow-Lenia physics (implementation and validation only, no experiments)

**Question / why:** add a mass-conserving continuous family (Flow-Lenia, Plantec et al. 2022/2023, arXiv 2212.07906), where matter is moved along a flow instead of created and destroyed. (J-013 is used on the parallel `v0.6-lenia-experiments` branch.)

**Built:**
- **Physics** (`physics/flow_lenia.py`, reimplemented from the paper's equations; the reference code has no licence and was not used): single channel, torus, FFT ring kernels and Gaussian growth, flow F = (1 − α)∇U − α∇A with α = clip(A², 0, 1) (θ_A = 1, n = 2), unnormalised 3×3 Sobel gradients with wrap, reintegration tracking (dt = 0.2, s = 0.65, displacement clipped to dd − s = 4.35). Labels `FLENIA/R13/m…/s…/h…/r…/a…/b…/w…`, kernels joined by `+`; `random()` uses the paper's ranges with R fixed at 13 and 1–3 kernels of 3 rings; `mutate()` always changes the label. `FLENIA/R13/diffusion` is the U = 0 control.
- **Storage (D-025):** uint8, A = state × 2/255, with largest-remainder rounding that keeps `sum(state)` exactly constant.
- Discovery niche family `flow_lenia`, dashboard colour ramp, CLI help.

**Found:**
- **Mass:** stored mass is exact over 1000 steps (101 636 → 101 636 levels); the float core drifts by 7.8e-14 relative. Capped cells (value > 255) hand out ~2 levels per step of ~10⁵ in a rule that saturates.
- **Rotation:** a rot90 seed evolves into the rot90 world (no cell differs by > 2 levels after 200 steps; centroid mismatch 0.00 cells), so the Sobel/grid and the rounding tie-break do not make fake motion.
- **No positive control found.** 88 random rules from the paper's 40×40 uniform patch (128×128 torus, 450–600 steps): 52 checked with the full detector (16 from `random()`, 24 with 3 kernels, 12 with 10 kernels) gave **0 movers and 0 self-propelled structures**; 36 more (12 with 1 kernel, 24 with 10) tracked by largest-object drift in both uint8 and float showed no clean mover (net displacement ≪ path). Most collapse into one or a few static blobs; the rest fragment and wobble. This agrees with the paper: random search gives mostly static patterns, and directed motion with one channel needed long optimisation (multi-channel was much easier).
- **Quantization friction (important):** flows below about half a level per cell per step are rounded away. Pure diffusion of the patch freezes in uint8 after < 50 steps (rms radius 16.6) but keeps spreading in float (22.2 at step 400). In the drift scan some rules wobble in float (path 23–42 cells) but are pinned in uint8 (1–6). Slow Flow-Lenia dynamics are therefore **not trustworthy** in the uint8 implementation.

**Validation:** 5 new probe checks (37/37; standard 39/39): exact mass, negative (static blob rule → not complex, quasi-static), deceptive (diffusion → no movers; rotated seed moves rotated), selection-aware null (random rules picked by the old objectives → none complex without a mover). There is **no Flow-Lenia positive**; the detector's positive is still the Lenia gliders. The diffusion control is weak because friction freezes it. 4 new tests (55).

**Caveats:** Sobel normalisation and displacement clipping are not stated in the paper (choices here: unnormalised, dd = 5). θ_A = 1 for one channel is our choice; the paper gives no value.

**Lesson:** an exactly conserved quantized state can still be the wrong physics: rounding friction stops slow flows, so a float (b) state is needed before reading anything from slow Flow-Lenia dynamics.

## J-012 · 2026-11-06 · Static Lenia blob fields were labelled "complex"; fixed for continuous physics

**Question / why:** a review found that the class label and the discovery objectives, tuned for 2-state rules, inflate Lenia results. `emergence observe "LENIA/R13/T10/m0.150/s0.0150/b1" --steps 1000 --size 128 --seed 1` returned **complex** for a field of 20 static blobs (0 movers, activity 0.041, local periodicity 0, no cycle). Three 2-state tests fire on continuous fields:
- **4+ persistent objects count as complex:** every blob of a settled Lenia soup is a persistent object, and the census counts *instances*, not shape types.
- **Any value change counts as activity,** and exact-cycle and exact local-periodicity tests never fire on continuous values.
- **Objectives reward static fields:** `vocabulary` (instances) and `aperiodic_activity` favour exactly these fields, so the search is pushed toward static blob fields. That fits 0 of 500 rules in E-12 run 1 producing a mover.

**First question: rounding noise or real dynamics?** Real. In the Orbium soup ([C-01]({{ '/experiments.html' | relative_url }}), `scripts/lenia_static_fields.py`):
- **Float64 does the same.** Continued for 3000 steps, both the quantized run and a float64 run without any rounding change 13% of cells by > 32 levels. 5% have changed after 100 steps.
- **Not ±1-level flicker.** Per-step changes reach 25 levels; only 4% of changing cells stay within 8 levels.
- **It is all at object edges.** 100% of changing cells are within 2 cells of an edge. 56% creep (net change > 32 levels in 100 steps) and 19% oscillate in place.

The blobs never travel; their edges relax slowly for thousands of steps. Calling this "frozen" would be as wrong as calling it "complex".

**Found:** 60 random Lenia rules (96×96, 500 steps). The old label called **27 complex**; all 27 have **no self-propelled structure**, and nearly all their persistent objects are still. The new label calls none complex. 26 are quasi-static, and 5 remain rankable `active` rules with real dynamics but nothing that travels (moving stripe textures, breathing ring-shaped blobs). None of the 60 has a self-propelled structure.

**Changed (continuous physics only; discrete labels, objectives and all 39 + 24 earlier benchmark results are unchanged and were checked byte for byte; D-022):**
- **Value tolerance:** activity and local periodicity ignore changes of ≤ 2 levels (of 255). The emergent glider changes its cells by a median of 19 levels per step; only 5% of its changes are ≤ 2.
- **Near-fixed point:** no change above the tolerance in the window → `frozen`. Tested with a jitter control: a fixed field with ±1-level flicker, which exact tests call active.
- **`complex`** needs at least one self-propelled structure; static persistent objects no longer count.
- **Quasi-static:** no self-propelled structure, and *free activity* (activity more than 3 cells away from objects that stay in place) below 0.002. Such runs are labelled `active` but count as settled, so they are never ranked or bred from, like frozen discrete runs (D-005).
- **Objectives:** `aperiodic_activity` uses free activity, and `vocabulary` counts persistent objects that are *not* still.
- **`analysis.complex_all_seeds`** (`emergence compare`) inherits the corrected label. Lenia results stored before this fix must be re-run.

**Caveats:**
- **The 0.002 cut-off is a judgment call.** It sits between the highest free activity of a field that looked static (0.0018) and the lowest of one that looked dynamic (0.0029), a 1.6× margin, set from 60 rules after viewing them. The `complex` label does not depend on it; ranking near it may flip.
- **Movers are the only route to `complex` in Lenia.** Creatures that rotate or pulse in place are not counted.

**Validation:** 8 new probe checks (32/32 Lenia and probe checks; 39/39 standard): positive (two emergent gliders → complex), negative (blob soup → not complex, quasi-static), deceptive (smoothed noise stays at zero; creeping soup is not frozen; jitter is frozen), a dynamic non-travelling rule stays rankable, and a selection-aware null. That null takes the random rules the *old* objectives would pick (most persistent objects; most activity): none may be complex without a mover. 51 tests.

**Also fixed:**
- **`Lenia.mutate`** could return the parent unchanged (one ring, add branch, coin flip fails). Small μ/σ steps could also round to the same label. Every mutation now changes the label, and the constructor rounds to label precision.
- **Emergent glider speed:** it is **~0.53 cells/step**, not ~0.1 as documented. Measuring over 200 steps on a 128-cell torus wraps around (106 cells > 64) and reads ≈ 0.11, which is probably where 0.1 came from.
- **`continuous.track`** is now annotated as returning a tuple.

**Rebuilt (lost with the cloud container, never committed):** the `smooth` start condition (D-023), and the conditions study now skips the exact-shape probes for continuous physics (`innovating` is reported as not applicable).

**Lesson:** a label or objective validated on one physics family must be re-validated with that family's own controls before its numbers are read.

## J-011 · 2026-11-05 · v0.5: Lenia physics and a tolerant structure detector

**Built (commit `85b289f`, rebased onto `main` after PR #3):**
- **Lenia physics** (`physics/lenia.py`): continuous states quantized to 256 levels, FFT convolution, ring kernels, Gaussian growth. Rules are written `LENIA/R13/T10/m0.150/s0.0150/b1`, and exploration varies μ, σ and the rings.
- **Tolerant structure census** (`observatory/continuous.py`): thresholded objects labelled on the torus, frame-to-frame tracking with a mass tolerance, persistent/still/mover counts, and a self-propulsion test on isolated clones.
- **Controls:** a smoothed-noise control physics and Lenia benchmark controls: two emergent gliders derived from the Orbium parameters (not hand-typed), a settled soup, smoothed noise, and a decaying lopsided blob (24/24).
- **Integration:** discovery, CLI and dashboard accept any physics. The exact-shape probes (innovation, replication, knockout) are marked not applicable for continuous physics.

**Ran (cloud, now lost):** E-12 run 1, a Lenia exploration. It reported about **44% of rules "complex"** and **0 of 500 rules with a mover**. Those numbers came from the inflated label (J-012) and **cannot be trusted**. The data, the `smooth` start condition, the conditions-study probe skip and the gallery clips were never committed and were lost with the cloud container. No E-12 data exists in this repository.

**Lesson:** commit or export before the container goes away; uncommitted cloud work is not a result.

## J-010 · 2026-11-05 · Knockout test: no evidence of cumulative innovation

**Question:** do earlier innovations *enable* later ones (cumulative innovation, objective O5)?

**Built:** `observatory/knockout.py` (D-020). When a new persistent type appears, three kinds of forked clone are run:
- **unchanged;**
- **knockout:** the new type deleted;
- **controls:** the same number of cells deleted from *old* structures.

The question is whether later novelty is lost more after the knockout than after the controls. Validated on:
- **positive:** a glider hits a block and leaves debris. Deleting the glider, or the first debris, removes 75–100% of the later novelties, against 0% for the controls;
- **negative:** deleting an uninvolved block;
- **deceptive:** Brian's Brain (20/20 probe checks pass).

**Ran:** E-09 to E-11 (92 knockouts across 22 rules × 4 initial conditions).

**Found:**
- **Set-based test, which asks whether the same new shapes appear:** 88 of 92 were *inconclusive*. Deleting old structure rewrote 50–90% of the future just as much as deleting the new type: any change spreads over 1000 steps. This happens even in rules whose 64-step damage measure is low, so the short damage measure underestimates sensitivity over long horizons.
- **Count-based test, which asks whether fewer new shapes appear:** added because of the above. Its first version flagged 5 "dependencies", but a **placebo test** (each control deletion treated as the target) shows real knockouts are **indistinguishable from placebos**: P(real > placebo) = 0.491 (E-11) and 0.510 (E-10). Only 1 real knockout exceeded the placebo's 95th percentile per run, against 1.5–3.1 expected by chance.

**Changed:** the count-based verdict now requires an actual drop, larger than every control's, of at least the placebo's 95th percentile (0.5). The study summary reports the population-level placebo test. Commits `b47ff1f`, `85c3c2e`, `1a48270`.

**Conclusion:** among universes that look like they keep innovating, **no new structure is necessary for later novelty**. The apparent innovation behaves like chance turnover in a sensitive (chaos-like) system. This is O5 tested and not observed, at this scale.

**Lessons:**
- In sensitive systems, compare interventions with **placebo interventions**, not with zero.
- A threshold chosen before seeing the null distribution will produce false positives.

## J-009 · 2026-11-05 · Initial conditions: the "environment" effect was a density effect

**Question (H4, from review R-3):** does *where* matter starts change what a fixed rule produces?

**Built:** initial-condition generators in `UniverseSpec.init`: uniform, gradient, central patch, spots (D-019). Old specs stay bit-identical (tested). `emergence conditions` runs a paired study: the same rules and seeds under each condition, with a sign test and a bootstrap CI, and outcomes fixed in advance.

**Ran:**
- **E-09:** 22 rules × 4 conditions × 3 seeds, 96×96, 2000 steps.
- **E-10:** a density-matched control.
- **E-11:** an exact rerun of E-09.

**Found:**
- **E-09:** starting from a central patch gave **+1.35 self-propelled shape types** (9 rules higher, 0 lower; p = 0.004, CI excludes 0). This was the only result that survived a Bonferroni correction across 9 tests. Conway's Life showed it most clearly (0 → 15 in one seed; see [Gallery]({{ '/gallery.html#life-central-patch' | relative_url }})).
- **But the patch also starts with less matter** (density 0.125 vs 0.35). **E-10** compared the patch with a uniform soup at the *same* 0.125 density: **no difference** (−0.08, 5 higher / 4 lower, p = 1). The effect came from **less matter, not localized matter**: sparser worlds let gliders survive.
- **Gradient:** slightly more universes still unsettled (+0.14, CI excludes 0, but sign test p = 0.125); weak, and not followed up yet.
- **E-11 reproduced E-09 exactly** on every primary outcome.

**Conclusion:** H4 as tested is not supported. Localizing matter (patch, spots) doesn't matter once density is matched. Density itself does.

**Lesson:** any "environment" comparison must hold the amount of matter fixed (D-021). Without E-10 we would have reported a false environment effect.

## J-008 · 2026-11-05 · Journal, docs and next-phase plan

**What:** Created this site (`docs/`, served by GitHub Pages), the agent handoff (`AGENTS.md`, [Handoff]({{ '/handoff.html' | relative_url }})), the experiment data exports (`docs/data/experiments/`) and a reproducible media pipeline (`scripts/make_media.py`, `scripts/make_figures.py`).

**Why:** The work had spread across chat sessions and two AI reviewers. Decisions and negative results were at risk of being lost, and a new agent couldn't have continued without the conversation history.

**Review:** ChatGPT's third review ([R-3]({{ '/reviews.html#r-3' | relative_url }})) recommended two research tracks: stronger innovation controls, and a second physics family (Lenia). It also suggested studying initial conditions. We agree with most of it, with three amendments (see [Research → Next steps]({{ '/research.html#next-steps' | relative_url }})):
- **Causal knockouts:** test whether earlier novelties *enable* later ones by removing them in a clone.
- **Initial conditions first:** start with the initial-conditions track, because it is cheap and needs no new physics.
- **Same-rule null:** prefer a same-rule, independent-seed null over generic space-time surrogates.

**Status:** plan proposed (D-018), not yet started.

## J-007 · 2026-11-05 · Round 5: innovation must be ongoing to count

**Ran:** E-08 (full pipeline, seed 12).

**Found:** Two universes were labelled "still innovating", yet their long runs had settled:
- **B3/S0123678** entered an exact cycle at t = 1737.
- **B17/S1348/C7** ended with 97% of its changing cells oscillating in place.

**Changed:** "Still innovating" now requires the extended run to remain unsettled; otherwise the verdict is *transient innovation that ended* (D-016). Commit `32df04e`.

**Lesson:** a claim in the present tense ("still innovating") must be checked at the end of the observation, not averaged over it.

---

## J-006 · 2026-11-05 · Round 4: sampling aliasing; chaos is inconclusive

**Found (E-07):**
- **#1169 B3/S1236/C7 (sampling aliasing):** it was flagged as innovating, but its long run sits in an exact cycle of period 840 from t = 933. Sparse sampling kept catching cycle phases it had not seen yet, and those looked like new shapes.
- **#173 B1678/S13478 (steady turnover):** it produces new shape types at a flat rate (75, 62, 52, 71 per quarter), and only ~5% of them recur. That is what a stationary noisy process gives by chance.

**Changed:**
- No innovation can be counted after an exact cycle begins.
- A flat new-type rate with damage spreading ≥ 0.3 is reported as *inconclusive* (a heuristic; a matched null is still open).

Commit `328c078`.

**Lesson:** i.i.d. noise is not a fair null for a spatially correlated chaotic rule.

---

## J-005 · 2026-11-05 · Rounds 2–3: innovation and replication probes

**Built:**
- **Innovation probe:** orientation-free persistent shape types tracked over a long run. "Established late" means first seen in the third quarter and seen again in the fourth. Each experiment runs a noise control that gives the false-positive floor.
- **Replication probe:** the shape alone in an empty clone, whose copy count must grow. Two null tests on random patterns: rule-level duplication and common product.
- **Evidence ladder** (D-014).
- **14 hard and deceptive controls** (D-012).

**Found while validating:**
- **Seeds false positives:** a scan of Seeds (B2/S) soups first reported **6 "self-replicators"**. They were simply common shapes that any explosion produces, so the *common product* null was added and rejects them.
- **Power-of-two artifact:** Fredkin's rule seemed not to replicate, because the 256-cell test world is a power of two and linear rules annihilate there. The test world is now 160 cells.
- **Explosive patterns:** they made the probe ~100× slower, so a cutoff marks them *explosive (untestable)*.

**Result (E-07):** 0 self-replicators among 9 candidates; the highest evidence level was 2 (#1181). Commit `7009020`.

**Lesson:** scanning the most common shapes selects exactly the shapes that background production favours. Every detector needs a null built around how its candidates were *selected*.

## J-004 · 2026-11-05 · Round 1: calibrated robustness and a random baseline

**Question:** does the discovery engine beat random search at all? It had never been tested.

**Ran:** E-03 to E-06: engine and random search, seeds 11 and 12, identical compute (100 rules × 2 seeds × 6 generations on 96×96).

**Found:**
- **The engine wins.** It finds 90 vs 29 rules with self-propelled shapes, 56.5 vs 8 rules "complex" on every seed, and 33 vs 25 niches.
- **The advantage shrinks after deduplication.** Counting only rules at least 2 mutations apart, it is **1.9×** and **4.2×**. About 40% of the raw advantage was near-duplicate mutants.

**Also:**
- **Robustness threshold:** recalibrated from each experiment's own seed variation (90th percentile ≈ 0.3). The old fixed 0.5 accepted 29% of pairs of *different* rules.
- **Tournament:** made explicit.
- **Naming:** "verified movers" renamed "self-propelled shapes".

Commit `b77f873`.

**Lesson:** report counts after removing near-duplicates whenever a search breeds from its own winners.

## J-003 · 2026-11-05 · Review R-2 and the v0.3 plan

ChatGPT reviewed v0.2 ([R-2]({{ '/reviews.html#r-2' | relative_url }})). We agreed on calibration, terminology and the evidence ladder. We pushed back on going straight to a replication detector, and on Fredkin's rule as the positive control: it copies *everything*, so it belongs with the deceptive controls, and HighLife's replicator is the real positive. We prioritised a random-search baseline and an innovation-over-time measure first.

---

## J-002 · 2026-11-05 · v0.2: validated discovery

**Built:**
- **Mover verification:** candidate movers are tested in isolated clones.
- **Seed screening:** every rule runs on 2 seeds on 96×96.
- **Niches:** MAP-Elites-style behaviour niches.
- **Longer runs:** a 4× extended run for each candidate, with verdicts *persists / fades / loops*.
- **Sustained objective:** a slowly dying universe now scores less.
- **Benchmark:** `emergence benchmark` (39/39) and a deterministic noise-control physics.

**Mistakes found and fixed during the run:**
- **Niche collapse:** the first niche axes put 90% of the eligible rules into one niche (just 4 niches occupied in generation 0), so the axes were redefined.
- **Missed cycles:** universes that fell into long exact cycles were reported as "persists".

**Result (E-02):**
- **Niches grew from 7 to 33**, and the multi-state share in the top 30 fell from 87% to 77%: a modest gain.
- **7 of 11 candidates settled** in their longer run, some only after ~3000 steps.
- **#1029**, a striped medium with moving defects, persisted. Its defects only move *within* the stripes, so they never count as self-propelled.

Commits `d9b2197`, `f394662`.

## J-001 · 2026-11-05 · v0.1: MVP and first evaluation

**Built:**
- **Engine:** Life-like and Generations automata on a torus, behind a physics interface.
- **Observatory:** activity, block entropy, compression against a shuffled copy, recurrence, structure census, damage spreading.
- **Discovery:** Pareto ranking plus novelty search.
- **Lab notebook:** SQLite, with deterministic seeding and `reproduce`.
- **Dashboard:** gallery, playback, rewind, zoom, comparison and lineage.

Commit `4a07778`.

**Found (E-01):**
- **Real phenomena:** novelty search found spiral waves and glider-rich rules without being told what to look for ([Gallery]({{ '/gallery.html' | relative_url }})).
- **Strobing rules:** initially ranked top, with ~99% of cells flipping every step. A *local periodicity* measure fixed this, and settled universes are now excluded from ranking (D-005).
- **Fields of independent oscillators:** they never repeat globally but are just repetition, and the same local periodicity measure catches them.
- **Family collapse:** multi-state rules grew from 28% to 73% of the population in 10 generations (fixed in v0.2).
- **Isolated mover candidates:** #463's mover later proved to be a false positive.

**Lesson:** the first versions of "interesting" are always fooled by something trivial. Look at the universes, not just the scores.
